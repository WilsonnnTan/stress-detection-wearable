# Stress Detection Using Wearable Devices

## Overview

This project focuses on early stress detection using data collected from wearable devices. It is designed to support multiple datasets and machine learning approaches to classify stress levels based on physiological signals.

### Currently Supported:
- ✅ **WESAD** (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection)
- ⏳ Additional datasets coming soon

### Features:
- 🧪 **Data preprocessing pipelines** to extract useful features from signals like ECG, EDA, EMG, etc.
- 🧠 **Machine learning models** (e.g., SVM, MLP) to classify stress vs. non-stress.
- 📊 **Evaluation scripts** using cross-validation and subject-specific metrics.
