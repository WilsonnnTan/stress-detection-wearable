# Stress Detection Using Wearable Devices - WESAD Dataset

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive approach to early stress detection using wearable devices, leveraging the WESAD datasetâ€”a widely recognized multimodal dataset for wearable stress and affect detection.

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing pipelines to handle raw physiological signals such as ECG, EDA, etc.
- Implementation of machine learning models to classify stress levels based on sensor data.
- Experiments with different feature extraction methods and model architectures.
- Support for integration with additional datasets to enhance robustness and generalization.
- Tools to facilitate reproducible research and easy experimentation.

This work aims to provide a foundation for researchers and practitioners interested in stress monitoring through wearable technology and IoT-based solutions.
